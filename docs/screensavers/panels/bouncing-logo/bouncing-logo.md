Customizable text bouncing off screen edges (DVD screensaver style) with color, size, 3D, and rotation options

## Overview

The bouncing-logo panel serves as an engaging DVD screensaver application that delivers customizable animated logos which oscillate across the display with various dynamic properties such as color variation and randomized movement in a simulated three-dimensional space. Primarily designed for personal desktop entertainment, this feature provides users with creative expression options through text selection, size settings, depth effects, motion rotation, and vibrant color schemes that mimic real-world bouncing objects to add visual appeal during periods of user inactivity on their computing devices. This application capitalizes on aesthetic customization while offering an interactive experience reminiscent of the anticipation inherent in waiting for favorite media content to commence, with occasional intentional deviations into corners and edges augmenting realism through unpredictability factors.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `text` | Custom text to bounce around the screen. Can be set via colon syntax (bouncing-logo:MyText) or settings. | No | `LCD` |
| `color` | Text color mode or specific color. Supports 'cycle' (changes on bounce), 'random' (random on bounce), 'rainbow' (smooth transition), HTML hex codes (#FF0000), or named colors (red, blue, green, etc.). | No | `cycle` |
| `size` | Text size preset: 'small' (32pt), 'medium' (64pt), or 'large' (96pt). Aliases: s, m, l, big. | No | `medium` |
| `3d` | Enable 3D depth effect with shadows and perspective transformation. When combined with rotate, creates a tumbling 3D effect. | No | `false` |
| `rotate` | Enable rotation animation. In 2D mode, rotates around the center. In 3D mode, tumbles in all directions with random speed changes every 2-6 seconds. | No | `false` |
| `thickness` | Text thickness/boldness (1-10). Affects stroke outline width and 3D depth shadow layers. If not specified, a random value (1-7) is chosen. Use 'random' to explicitly request random thickness. | No | `random` |
| `speed` | Movement speed (1-10). 1 = crawling (0.05x), 5 = normal speed (1.0x), 10 = very fast (2.0x). Controls how quickly the logo bounces around the screen. | No | `5` |
