Floating, bouncing translucent bubbles

## Overview

The LCDPossible bubbles screensaver serves as an interactive visual enhancement designed to provide users with a calming and visually engaging experience by displaying floating translucent colored bubbles within the display area. This feature is particularly suited for personalized digital signage, virtual backgrounds during video calls, or simply unwinding after work hours when using compatible LCD displays. Its core capabilities include customizable bubble sizes with soft reflections and highlight effects that simulate gentle floating motion alongside subtle translucent overlapping to create an immersive ambiance without disrupting the user's primary tasks on-screen.
