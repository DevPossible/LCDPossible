GPU usage with graphical bars

## Overview

The LCDPossible GPU usage graphic panel provides real-time visual feedback on graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization by presenting color-coded progress bars for core usage and video memory allocation alongside a temperature readout. This is particularly useful in system monitoring to ensure optimal performance without overloading the hardware components, facilitating immediate corrective action if thresholds are exceeded.
