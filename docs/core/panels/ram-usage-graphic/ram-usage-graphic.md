RAM usage with graphical bar

## Overview

The ram-usage-graphic panel within LCDPossible serves as an intuitive and visually engaging tool designed to monitor memory usage in real time for systems employing professional display setups that integrate with this application suite. It provides users a clear representation of both the total available RAM and current utilization through a progressively sized bar, accompanied by precise percentage metrics displayed alongside absolute values expressed in gigabytes (GB). Color-coded indicators within the visual element further inform on usage intensity levels directly at a glance, facilitating immediate action if necessary. This feature is particularly beneficial for IT professionals and system administrators who require efficient oversight of memory resources to maintain optimal performance standards across professional LCD displays in enterprise environments.
