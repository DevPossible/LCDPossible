CPU temperature with graphical gauge display

## Overview

The LCDPossible cpu-thermal-graphic panel serves as an essential tool within computational environments by providing real-time visualization of CPU temperatures through a thermometer-style gauge display. Its capabilities extend to color-coding the temperature levels in green, yellow, and red for immediate recognition of thermal states, with additional min/max indicators when available, thus facilitating effective monitoring and preemptive measures against potential overheating issues that may impact system performance or longevity.

## Details

Displays CPU temperature as a visual gauge:
- Thermometer-style visualization
- Current temperature value
- Color-coded (green/yellow/red) based on temperature
- Min/Max indicators if available

## Dependencies

- LibreHardwareMonitorLib

## Examples

### Display CPU temperature gauge

```bash
lcdpossible show cpu-thermal-graphic
```


## Profile Usage

### Add to Profile

```bash
# Add panel to default profile
lcdpossible profile append-panel cpu-thermal-graphic

# Add with custom duration (30 seconds)
lcdpossible profile append-panel "cpu-thermal-graphic|@duration=30"
```

### Quick Show

```bash
