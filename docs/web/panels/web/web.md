Renders a live website from URL

## Overview

LCDPossible is an advanced LCD controller application designed to display live websites directly on large displays with high resolutions pertinent to professional settings. It seamlessly renders full web pages inclusive of CSS and JavaScript content in real-time using a headless Chromium browser, offering features such as auto-refresh at configurable intervals, session state persistence through cookies/session storage, which are ideal for applications like weather displays, stock tickers, financial data updates, server monitoring dashboards, and the creation of custom web dashboards. Although its initial render may require a brief waiting period due to browser initialization, LCDPossible stands as an efficient solution tailored primarily towards real-time corporate information dissemination needs where visual immediacy is crucial alongside functional display capabilities.
