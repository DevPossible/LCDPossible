List of VMs and containers with status and resource usage

## Overview

The LCDPossible panel serves as an essential tool within Proxmox by offering administrators real-time visibility into their VM and container environments across clusters; it provides a structured view of the status, resource consumption, and location for each virtual machine and container with ease due to its interactive interface. This application is invaluable for monitoring critical performance metrics such as CPU load and memory usage directly within Proxmox'an infrastructure management system, facilitating proactive scaling decisions or identifying potential bottlenecks swiftly. With the simplicity of scrolling through an expansive list that adapts to its length, LCDPossible enables a seamless user experience in overseeing complex virtual environments efficiently and effectively for optimizing overall resource utilization within enterprise-scale deployments.
